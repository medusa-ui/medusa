Pages are simply written in HTML and enhanced with Medusa expressions to allow for efficient DOM rewrites. Following the model set forth from Elixir/Phoenix Liveview, all interactivity is handled serverside through WebSockets. The event-driven serverside code is written around non-blocking Spring Reactive. You have to write no Javascript but get full interactivity.
